Iâ€™m a quantum physicist turned ML researcher passionate about physics and AI. Currently, I am working on AI for medical applications at <a href="https://verily.com/press/verily-opens-new-r-d-center-in-israel-focused-on-the-application-of-ai-in-healthcare/" target="_blank">Verily AI Research</a>. I did my graduate studies in Quantum Computing at <a href="https://www.physics.uva.edu/" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>.

In my free time I write about tech and philosophy. Check it out at <a href="https://nirsd.substack.com" target="_blank">Substack</a>.
